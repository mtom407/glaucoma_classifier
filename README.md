# glaucoma_classifier
Transfer learning deep neural network for glaucoma binary classification task

Part of the final year engineering project from my studies at Warsaw's University of Technology.

**Disclaimer**: The training scripts presented in this repository require medical data in order to train and test deep learning models. I cannot share this data here. The code in this repository can be regarded as a starter code for someone who is undertaking a glaucoma classification task on their own data.

Scripts in this repo:
- vgg_glaucoma_training - code used for training a VGG16 architecture using transfer learning (weights from ImageNet)
- vgg_glaucoma_test - code used for testing models trained with the other script
